title("Min CPL vs. Damper Settings")
% Here, the minimum CPL is the smallest wheel load the car sees on the
% shaker given a typical road input, this usually happens when the car is
% at its unsprung mode. The reason why this is considered alongside the RMS
% CPLV is that you don't want a car that surpresses everything really well
% but then gives a super huge primary mode oscillation. This metric is more
% tied to the performance of the vehicle under large body movement such as
% straight line max braking and step steer.

title("Hub Pitch vs. Damper Settings")
% "Hub pitch" is the difference between the front and rear unsprung mass
% displacement at any given time. This is important because the test input
% is pure heave. A strong pitch correlates to uneven motion of the front
% and rear wheel, indicating a mismatch in stiffness or damping.
